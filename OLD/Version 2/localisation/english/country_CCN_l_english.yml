CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1: "Panzerkampfwagen III"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc: "As early as 1005/1006, General Vect envisioned two basic tank types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future Changeling Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1_short: "Panzer III"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2: "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3: "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc: "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

His belief that love can be obtained with friendship and peaceful trading with their neighbours has been slowly catching on among the despondent drones, who feel their lives are being thrown away in pursuit of militaristic expansion. Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole. That has changed after his successful return from exile and revolution, as Thorax has assumed leadership of the Hives and does his best to lead his species to a bright future."

PT_CCN_fight_for_whats_right: "We fight for what is right!"
PT_CCN_fight_for_whats_right_desc: "We are traitors, rebels guilty of the highest treason; however, ours is a fully righteous cause. All we want is freedom and an end to our isolation. Whatever Chrysalis and anyling loyal to her says about us, however much they lie about us and put us down as pathetic traitors, we are stalwart in our stance and eternally fierce in our resistance."

PT_CCN_seek_aid_from_para_and_corps_desc: "Only a fool is convinced that we will be able to win without any foreign support. Just like many other revolutions, this one needs help from paramilitary groups and corporations and as well others."
PT_CCN_reoccupy_old_forts: "Reoccupy Old Forts"
PT_CCN_reoccupy_old_forts_desc: "Abandoned relics of our fractured, violent past are scattered all around the countryside and near our towns. Now that we are once more fractured, leaving these old forts abandoned would be foolish and silly. They’re not up to date and look like they should be museums, but will have to be adequate for the time being."
PT_CCN_dig_up_new_fortifications: "Dig Up New Fortifications"
PT_CCN_dig_up_new_fortifications_desc: "These ancient emplacements simply are not trustable. They have deteriorated to structural questionability and are no longer in as strategic of locations as they might have once been. More, up-to-date fortifications are needed, especially in and around our greatest cities such as Antax in case our lines are broken through that deeply. It shall be done."
PT_CCN_hidden_airfields: "Hidden Airfields"
PT_CCN_hidden_airfields_desc: "Vast swaths of our controlled land are forested thickly – we can use that. By clearing out just enough trees to fit an airstrip while keeping any other buildings nestled into the trees, and of course, using as much foliage as possible, we can construct highly undetectable airbases from which to deploy our aircraft."
PT_CCN_hidden_paths: "Hidden Paths"
PT_CCN_hidden_paths_desc: "Terrain can be practically nightmarish to travers in long distances, especially in the winter. As such, a network of tunnels, trails and small roads will begin construction to relieve this difficulty somewhat, especially in forests and swamps. It’s highly preferred that these paths be as concealed as possible and only known by lings who need to know of them."
PT_CCN_border_raids_into_queens_territory: "Border Raids Into Other Queen's Territory"
PT_CCN_border_raids_into_queens_territory_desc: "We are simply starved of weaponry and see ourselves with no other choice! Infiltrators and raiding parties must be sent into the regions of neighbouring have queens to retrieve as many weapons as manageable. It will not exactly be pretty or clean, but it has to be done."
PT_CCN_borrow_equipment_from_bears: "'Borrow' Equipment From Bears"
PT_CCN_borrow_equipment_from_bears_desc: "The bears are only sitting stationary while we fight for out lives! They must not understand that it will be them who are fighting for their lives next if we are to collapse!

PT_CCN_formulate_actual_army: "Formulate An Actual Army"
PT_CCN_formulate_actual_army_desc: "Having an actual organised armed force would be very useful to the war cause. It will make communicating with different units and divisions much easier while making it harder for the enemy to cut off any of our units."
PT_CCN_convince_generals_to_join_our_side: "Convince Generals To Join Our Side"
PT_CCN_convince_generals_to_join_our_side_desc: "While we already have a descent amount of generals, it will not hurt to get more from the minor queens nearby. It will be hard to convince them that Harmonism is the way and that Thorax will see our race rise up from the Love Famine that we are facing under Chrysalis' regime but we must do it as it is a matter of life and death."
PT_CCN_aquire_arms_from_across_world: "Aquire Arms From Across The World"
PT_CCN_aquire_arms_from_across_world_desc: "A rebellion rarely can survive on its own, we are no different as we require more weapons to fight back Chrysalis and her Loyalists. Thorax already has good ties with Equestria and several other countries, so we should reach out to them."
PT_CCN_aquire_heavy_equipment_and_attaches: "Aquire Heavy Equipment and Attaches"
PT_CCN_aquire_heavy_equipment_and_attaches_desc: "Chrysalis have armour that right now we struggle to take out, not only that, our generals are poorly trained and not experienced with military tactics and strategies. We must seek help with both training and penetrating heavier enemies."
PT_CCN_establish_forest_hunters: "Establish Forest Hunters"
PT_CCN_establish_forest_hunters_desc: "Sharpshooters play a very important role in any conflict. Right now, we do not have any, that must change soon. It is time to establish the Forest Hunters."

PT_CCN_convince_pharynx_to_join_desc: "Pharynx; an Chrysalis loyalist and my brother will be one stubborn changeling to convince to join our side, the generals and governmental staff are not full of hope that he will be able to be convinced until he sees the good under Thorax's rule, I am very hopeful of doing this, I will just need to come at the right angle."
PT_CCN_maintain_militia_system: "Maintain Militia System"
PT_CCN_maintain_militia_system_desc: "While not the best, the militia system we have right now is serving us well, it would be silly to risk a total collapse of our front to reform the system right now. We will have enough time to reform the system after we win this civil war."
PT_CCN_sharpshooter_field_training: "Sharpshooter Field Training"
PT_CCN_sharpshooter_field_training_desc: "Sharpshooting is a hard job that not alot of people are trained in, shooting at extreme ranges is not as easy as aim and fire, sharpshooters will need to take the wind speed, bullet speed and many other factors in account to lay down accurate fire. Unfortunately we do not have the funding nor the time to establish schools for them but that does not mean we cant train them in the field. "
PT_CCN_establish_rebel_cells: "Establish Rebel Cells Inside Enemy Territory"
PT_CCN_establish_rebel_cells_desc: "Rebel cells within Chrysalis’ controlled territory could be the key to win this civil war. We must see that they are established and empowered. "
PT_CCN_promote_new_officers: "Promote New Officers"
PT_CCN_promote_new_officers_desc: "We can not rely on the minor queens for everything, we must be able to survive on our own to gain their trust and support and in order to do that, promoting new officers will not be such a bad idea."
PT_CCN_secure_their_loyalty: "Secure Their Loyalty"
PT_CCN_secure_their_loyalty_desc: "A war cause is all but lost if said generals are not loyal to their commanders and leaders. IF we are to win this civil war, we must test the loyalty of every single general to Thorax and the cause."

PT_CCN_gain_assistance_from_neighbours: "Gain Assistance From Neighbours"
PT_CCN_gain_assistance_from_neighbours_desc: "This war cannot be won by ourselves! We will have to create new allies from both our neighbours and abroad should we win this war and achive victory against Tyranny!"
PT_CCN_visiting_queens: "Visiting The Queens"
PT_CCN_visiting_queens_desc: "An obvious place to look for help is the major hive queens, plenty of whom have spotty relationships to Chrysalis for one reason or another. Of course, we cannot expect them to be all that welcoming of us if we are unwilling to let them rule their own hives with at least some degree of autonomy. Compromises are inevitably necessary."
PT_CCN_gaining_favors: "Gaining Favors"
PT_CCN_gaining_favors_desc: "Chrysalis is still a powerful ruler even if she’s weakened. No hive queen can stand alone against her raw power or far-reaching hooves she has all around Telzorta. This is where we may come in. Weapon donations, aid with rooting out Chrysalian infiltration networks, promises to defend their land as our own and to work together against the deranged tyrant are all things that we can offer to hive queens, if of course we possess the means for them."
PT_CCN_informal_trade: "Informal Trade"
PT_CCN_informal_trade_desc: "Another option for us is, instead of donating weapons to the hive queens, we can donate large sections of our economy to them in return for their weapons. This will hopefully have the effect of reducing the need for the hive queens to use force to retain power, as our economic aid will make them more prosperous. Which will be what allows them to sell us weapons in the first place. This trade can be very beneficial!"
PT_CCN_red_question: "The Red Question"
PT_CCN_red_question_desc: "North of us, Stalliongradian Communists lead by the former exile, Gold Muffin, have set up a revolutionary movement based around Gorak. This cannot be reasonably trusted as anything more than an extension of the Stalliongradian state into Telzorta; however, they are not hostile to us at the moment and are with us in opposition to Chrysalis. A decision must be reached, on whether or not to focus solely on deposing chrysalis and thus make Gold Muffin our “ally”, or to have nothing to do with him and pursue a rapid end to this Stalliongradian doll as soon as we’ve delt with Chrysalis."
PT_CCN_form_united_front: "Form A United Front"
PT_CCN_form_united_front_desc: "We have decided that Chrysalis is still enough of a threat that drawing attention from her would be folly. The Communists, whether we like it or not, are our allies. A united Anti-Chrysalian front will be proposed to Gold Muffin so that our militaries can work together and support each other."
PT_CCN_they_must_be_eliminated: "They Must Be Eliminated!"
PT_CCN_they_must_be_eliminated_desc: "We did NOT rise up out of the chains of tyranny just to make another tyrant to rule over us! The actions of the Stalliongradian puppets are nothing short of sickening and evil as they will not let anyling own so much as a square inch of their own private property. Gold Muffin and his supporters are thieves and murderers hiding behind a façade of morality, and such people will not and cannot be tolerated in a free Telzorta."
PT_CCN_friends_in_high_places: "Friends In High Places"
PT_CCN_friends_in_high_places_desc: "It is thanks to the dragon, Spike, that Thorax was able to return form this exile from Telzorta. Spike is already enough of a hero for this feat alone, but the struggle against Chrysalis is not yet over! Our armies and movement at large hunger for weapons and all kinds of materials. If we can once again gain Spike’s favor to allow Equestrian aid to enter our lands, there is a very good chance that the royal court will assent."
PT_CCN_gather_aid_from_crystal_empire: "Gather Aid From Crystal Empire"
PT_CCN_gather_aid_from_crystal_empire_desc: "Equestria is the ultimate beacon of Harmony and freedom on Equus; help from them would be the most helpful of all! It is no secret what Chrysalis intends to do if she once more gains power across Telzorta. In the name of basic morality and to avert potentially the most devastating war in Equus’ history, help us, Equestria!"
PT_CCN_gain_favor_from_sun_and_moon: "Gain Favor From Sun And Moon"
PT_CCN_gain_favor_from_sun_and_moon_desc: "Equestria is the ultimate beacon of Harmony and freedom on Equus; help from them would be the most helpful of all! It is no secret what Chrysalis intends to do if she once more gains power across Telzorta. In the name of basic morality and to avert potentially the most devastating war in Equus’ history, help us, Equestria!"
PT_CCN_aquire_volunteers_division: "Aquire Volunteers Division"
PT_CCN_aquire_volunteers_division_desc: "Material aid is one thing, but real military support is another. We need soldiers, officers, generals! Not just the guns they hold or the food they eat. Only so much of Telzorta’s population can be sent to war before out whole society ceases to function and/or the average drone begins to see Thorax as a greedy warlord as well."

PT_CCN_queen_argynnis_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 975\n\n§YBiography§!: The martial hive of Vraks has always had a tenuous relationship with Vesalipolis, at best. The two had for centuries engaged in skirmishes and raids before Vraks attacked the other hive with full force but was repelled by Chrysalis and her allies from Ditrysium. In 971 Chrysalis struck back with an expanded alliance and crushed Vraks, whose Queen committed suicide rather than face Chrysalis' wrath. Her oldest hatchling, Argynnis, thus became Queen. She holds no grudge against Chrysalis and recognizes her might, but never skips an opportunity to make a mocking, sarcastic comment if she fails."
PT_CCN_queen_yaria_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 969\n\n§YBiography§!: Queen of the largest northern hive of Soryth, which lies on the shore of the Key Lake. The Key Lake is known for its concentration of magical energy. Magic helped changelings of Soryth to survive harsh northern weather for generations. Queen Yaria believes that thorough study of magical abilities of crystals is vital for future success of the changeling nation. She is one of the queens who joined Chrysalis voluntarily and genuinely believes she can lead their race to greatness. In her eyes, changelings have the same potential for magic abilities as unicorns, if they only develop it enough."
PT_CCN_queen_aurantia_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 957\n\n§YBiography§!: The aging queen of the industrial hive-city of Lyctida is able to provide resources and lumber for our railroads and military equipment. Ever since Chrysalis lead her alliance to save Lyctida from marauding deer zealots, she has been her most loyal supporter. She always strives to earn Chrysalis' favour, but she in turn sees Aurantia as a useful and reliable pawn until she eventually dies from old age."
PT_CCN_queen_helvia_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 970\n\n§YBiography§!: The young queen of the thriving port hive of Ditrysium is interested in commercial expansion and increase of naval production. While Ditrysium was the first major hive to ally Vesalipolis, Helvia is not as fond of Chrysalis as her predecessor. The debacle of 1002 eventually led to communist sailors rioting in Ditrysium and Chrysalis crushed the resistance personally without asking Helvia. However, she is pragmatic and knows maintaining good relations with Vesalipolis is ultimately a positive thing."
PT_CCN_queen_muffin_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! Who cares?!?\n\n§YBiography§!: \n"Doesn't matter. We all know he's a dirty stinking §Rcommie§! and all he cares about is ruining my §Bamerican freedom!§! Stop fucking glorifying him." -Jay"

PT_CCN_queendom_vraks_desc: "For the longest time Vraks and Vesalipolis have been rivals on the battlefield. For centuries, the changelings of Vraks have fought against their bigger northern neighbour with all their might. Sensing weakness in Queen Chrysalis, the hive led a full on assault on her home, which was only barely beaten back by the Queen. Years later, Vraks would be humiliated and finally put down and Vesalipolis would become the changeling metropole. The Vrakkians have now accepted the hegemony of Chrysalis, accepting her strength and excited to battle new enemies."
PT_CCN_queendom_soryth_desc: "Far to the northeast, on the shores of the Key Lake, Soryth stretches out. The sprawling hive is built in what the changelings would consider a non-crowded way, but for other creatures, even Soryth might feel cramped still. Key Lake is the reason why so many changelings endure the cold winters of the north of Equus and it is the city's most valuable resource. For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water."
PT_CCN_queendom_lyctida_desc: "The Hive of Lyctida lies in the middle of thick forests, and with the smoke from factories and lumber mills, the city is always a bit dark and at night, the moon and stars have difficulty illuminating the Black Hive. Lyctida is a sombre place, but for many changelings, it is still home. The hivelings are bugs of few words, preferring the company of machinery or the solitude of the forests. With the streets silent, the scenery drab and the company stoic, Lyctida receives few visitors."
PT_CCN_queendom_distryum_desc: "The Hive of Ditrysium was one of the first to ally with Vesalipolis when the hives were being unified, which paid of immensely for the port city. It is located at the far end of a protective fjord, allowing ships natural shelter from the elements. As one of the major commercial hubs for the changelings, Ditrysium is the link of the Changeling Lands to the outside world. It is also where the changelings are preparing their advancements in naval warfare. Drones buzz endlessly around the dry-docks to manufacture warships for the hives. "
