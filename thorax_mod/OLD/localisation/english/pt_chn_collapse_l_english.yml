PT_Collapse.2.t:0 "The Final Question"
PT_Collapse.2.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis fancied herself untainted by weakness, by simplicity or moderation. For the Changeling Queen, everything was a spectacle if she could make it one, every little victory and every grand triumpth was always put on display for all to see, all to fear.\n Yet, the days had worn long on her, the countless sleepless nights she had spent concentrating on nothing but her inevitable vengeance, first against the loathsome ponies who had denied her victory, then against Thorax and his band of traitors as they tore the unity of Changelings she had built around herself down to nothing.\n Now Thorax was dead, his forces scattered, nothing remained to hate, so why did sleep still elude her? In the midst of all of it, she let go of her paranoia, she let go of her constant scheming, uncharacteristically taking a simple walk alone through the hive she called her own, through her capital. No Changelings were about, curfew was strict, and the punishment for disobedience was stricter still. The Queen pondered and pondered for ages on end, the seething rage and megalomaniacal glee that were her only normal moods simmered and smothered to nothing by the loss of thought and feeling that nagged on her incessantly. She had done this before, repeated these same steps, conquered the hives and crushing all opposition. She had done it before, she had just done it again, would she be forced to do it a third time? The Queen of Vesalipolis stood lost in trrents of violent thoughts and petty doubts she had seldom experienced before, amongst the spires of industry and rows upon rows of the housing she herself had orchestrated and built to perfection, she wondered if it was all worth it, if she would be remembered.\n\nEven if she burnt every last dissident piece of literature, ensured every history book portrayed her genious appropriately and filled generation after generation with loyalty to her and their lips would bear naught but the songs of her glory-\n\nWould she be remembered?\n\n What would those who came after think of her? Would they see the Queen who made the necessary decisions to save her race? Who crushed the foreigners who had spited them for so long and ensured the best for her subjects? Or would she be seen as a narcissistic, self-centered, egotistical tyrant only out to avenge her own failings?\n\n In other words, would they see the truth, or the lie? Would all that she had done, conquering these same lands and bringing them unto unity twice, and all that she would do, conquering the Equestrians and ensuring Changeling domination, have purpose?\n The Queen of the Changelings found herself lacking in response, her usual confidence and zealous self-indulgence in praises and fantasies of extravagence dried up in the face of the question she now saw clearly, the one she had asked herself since the fervor and hate for her enemies died down when the rebellion was quashed.\n\n All she had done, all she would do and everything she had created and destroyed-"
