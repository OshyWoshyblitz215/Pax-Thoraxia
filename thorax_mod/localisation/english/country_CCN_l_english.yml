CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1: "Panzerkampfwagen III"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc: "As early as 1005/1006, General Vect envisioned two basic tank types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future Changeling Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2: "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

politics_thorax_desc: "An outcast among the Hives, Thorax is one of the first supporters of Harmony among the changelings. His belief that love can be obtained with friendship and peaceful trading with their neighbours has been slowly catching on among the despondent drones, who feel their lives are being thrown away in pursuit of militaristic expansion. Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole. That has changed after his successful return from exile and revolution, as Thorax has assumed leadership of the Hives and does his best to lead his species to a bright future."

PT_CCN_queen_argynnis_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 975\n\n§YBiography§!: The martial hive of Vraks has always had a tenuous relationship with Vesalipolis, at best. The two had for centuries engaged in skirmishes and raids before Vraks attacked the other hive with full force but was repelled by Chrysalis and her allies from Ditrysium. In 971 Chrysalis struck back with an expanded alliance and crushed Vraks, whose Queen committed suicide rather than face Chrysalis' wrath. Her oldest hatchling, Argynnis, thus became Queen. She holds no grudge against Chrysalis and recognizes her might, but never skips an opportunity to make a mocking, sarcastic comment if she fails."
PT_CCN_queen_yaria_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 969\n\n§YBiography§!: Queen of the largest northern hive of Soryth, which lies on the shore of the Key Lake. The Key Lake is known for its concentration of magical energy. Magic helped changelings of Soryth to survive harsh northern weather for generations. Queen Yaria believes that thorough study of magical abilities of crystals is vital for future success of the changeling nation. She is one of the queens who joined Chrysalis voluntarily and genuinely believes she can lead their race to greatness. In her eyes, changelings have the same potential for magic abilities as unicorns, if they only develop it enough."
PT_CCN_queen_aurantia_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 957\n\n§YBiography§!: The aging queen of the industrial hive-city of Lyctida is able to provide resources and lumber for our railroads and military equipment. Ever since Chrysalis lead her alliance to save Lyctida from marauding deer zealots, she has been her most loyal supporter. She always strives to earn Chrysalis' favour, but she in turn sees Aurantia as a useful and reliable pawn until she eventually dies from old age."
PT_CCN_queen_helvia_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 970\n\n§YBiography§!: The young queen of the thriving port hive of Ditrysium is interested in commercial expansion and increase of naval production. While Ditrysium was the first major hive to ally Vesalipolis, Helvia is not as fond of Chrysalis as her predecessor. The debacle of 1002 eventually led to communist sailors rioting in Ditrysium and Chrysalis crushed the resistance personally without asking Helvia. However, she is pragmatic and knows maintaining good relations with Vesalipolis is ultimately a positive thing."

PT_CCN_queendom_vraks_desc: "For the longest time Vraks and Vesalipolis have been rivals on the battlefield. For centuries, the changelings of Vraks have fought against their bigger northern neighbour with all their might. Sensing weakness in Queen Chrysalis, the hive led a full on assault on her home, which was only barely beaten back by the Queen. Years later, Vraks would be humiliated and finally put down and Vesalipolis would become the changeling metropole. The Vrakkians have now accepted the hegemony of Chrysalis, accepting her strength and excited to battle new enemies."
PT_CCN_queendom_soryth_desc: "Far to the northeast, on the shores of the Key Lake, Soryth stretches out. The sprawling hive is built in what the changelings would consider a non-crowded way, but for other creatures, even Soryth might feel cramped still. Key Lake is the reason why so many changelings endure the cold winters of the north of Equus and it is the city's most valuable resource. For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water."
PT_CCN_queendom_lyctida_desc: "The Hive of Lyctida lies in the middle of thick forests, and with the smoke from factories and lumber mills, the city is always a bit dark and at night, the moon and stars have difficulty illuminating the Black Hive. Lyctida is a sombre place, but for many changelings, it is still home. The hivelings are bugs of few words, preferring the company of machinery or the solitude of the forests. With the streets silent, the scenery drab and the company stoic, Lyctida receives few visitors."
PT_CCN_queendom_distryum_desc: "The Hive of Ditrysium was one of the first to ally with Vesalipolis when the hives were being unified, which paid of immensely for the port city. It is located at the far end of a protective fjord, allowing ships natural shelter from the elements. As one of the major commercial hubs for the changelings, Ditrysium is the link of the Changeling Lands to the outside world. It is also where the changelings are preparing their advancements in naval warfare. Drones buzz endlessly around the dry-docks to manufacture warships for the hives. "

PT_thoraxian.1.t: "The Thoraxian Betrayal"
PT_thoraxian.1.desc: "With supporters for harmony and friendship growing larger and larger within the hives scattered across changeling lands, it was only time before those upstarts thought themselves too good for the strength and unity of the Queen. Thorax and his supporters, as well as numerous detractors of Chrysalis, have all united under the banner of 'harmony'.\n\nThe rebels took control of the forests around Antax in the east of country."

PT_thoraxian.2.desc: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Reports come from a few local forces in the Major Forest that harmonist rebels have begun their uprising, following the return of Thorax, the harmonist changeling leader, from exile. \nChrysalis is convinced that he's behind it all, and has therefore announced that "The rebel vermin plaguing our great nation will be crushed and purged!""

PT_thoraxian.5.t: "Ditrysium leaves hegemony"
PT_thoraxian.5.desc: "Due to Chrysalis sending in troops to get rid of the riots in north and her guards being... overly eager to restore order, queen Helvia has chosen to expell all Chrysalises troops and seek to deal with the unrest herself.\n\nOr something like that, idk.\n\nConsider making a save file here cuz you got a choice to support them or not."

PT_thoraxian.8.t: "Vraks-Soryth Declaration"
PT_thoraxian.8.desc: "Early this morning a joint declaration by the Queens of Vraks and Soryth along with surrounding hives have annouced their sucession from the Changeling hegemony. Declaring neutrality in the civil war, local hive militias were mobilized and escorted the Heer and Harmonists out of the hives territories.\n\nQueen Yaria had justified her sucession by saying she wished to spare her realm burdens of civil war. Going off stage she was heard saying off mic to Argynnis \"If any of those fuckers touch my research I swear I will test my hypothesis on them how long they can stay alive having their chitin peeled off!\"\n\n[PT_thoraxian_8_speech]"
PT_thoraxian.8.a: "Argynnis speech is scripted localization based on if the commies rose up or not"
PT_thoraxian_8_uprising: "Queen of Vraks, Argynnis justified her sucession with the threat posed by communist uprising in the north, using terms such as \"Bruh\", \"It's Joever\" and \"Better dead than red\" \nAfter delivering the speech she refused to elaborate further and left the stage."
PT_thoraxian_8_crackdown: "Queen of Vraks, Argynnis justified her sucession with the sucessfull crackdown performed by Helvia compared to Chrysalises Guard, using terms such as \"Skill issue\" \"Commie Bussy Rapefest\" and \"Big Chrissie L\"\nAfter delivering the speech she refused to elaborate further and left the stage."
PT_thoraxian.9.t: "Lyctida"
PT_thoraxian.9.desc: "Following the urging of the surrounding hive queens and her love addicted daughter, the old Queen of Lyctida, Aurantia gave a speech proclaiming her sucession from the hegemony. Going up to the speech podium she tripped twice on the stairs, and while giving the speech was blabbering incoherently. The speech ended when she fell asleep behind the mic and her daughter escorted her away. \n\nLater that day it was annouced she would be dropping out of the \"Queen of Badass\" contest due to health issues, putting her daughter to end the race for her. Current polls show that Argynnis is on her way to win, following a failed asassinaition attempt earlier that week which grazed her right ear."

PT_thoraxian.10.t: "End of Hegemony"
PT_thoraxian.10.desc: "Since all queens used their \"fuck it we ball\" rights to GTFO Chrissies wild ride, the hegemony was officially desolved and renamed to \"Vesalipoilis Queendom\", undoing most of her lifes work unifying the changeling lands. Experts debate if this move will help her win the war or if it was done meerly to show off the scripters abilities."
