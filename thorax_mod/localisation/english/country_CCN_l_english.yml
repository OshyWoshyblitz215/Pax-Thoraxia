CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1005/1006, General Vect envisioned two basic tank types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future Changeling Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

thoraxian.16.t:0 "Velvet accepted!"
thoraxian.16.d:0 "Velvet was wooed by Thorax's boldness, and agreed to marriage. The ceremony was uneventful, but still celebrated across the two nations with joy from the citizens.

While continuing to rule from Vesalipolis is the easiest to justify, considering it's where changelings have ruled from for nearly all time, arguments have to be made for moving the capital to the Olenian capital in Hjortland.\n\nAlternatively, arguments have been made for moving the capital to two of the Olenian and Changeling's biggest cities, Vaverfront and Vraks. While not as significant historically as the two current capitals, moving it to one of the other two may bring a sense of unity to the newly formed commonwealth."

After explaining that the new government wanted to distance itself from the previous acts of aggression perpetrated by the changelings, an offer of an official non-aggression pact between our two nations to solidify our new relationship was presented to us."
thoraxian.22.a:0 "Of course, we will accept. For peace and prosperity!"
thoraxian.22.b:0 "This has to be some sort of changeling trick!."
thoraxian.23.t:0 "Equestria Accepted!"
thoraxian.23.d:0 "After a short period of waiting, we have finally received a reply from Equestria!

thoraxian.23.a:0 "We will put the mistakes of the past behind us."
thoraxian.24.t:0 "Equestria Refused?"
thoraxian.24.d:0 "According to an envoy from Equestria, our offer of a non-aggression pact between our two nations has been rejected? We received no official reason for this rejection and are left quite puzzled by the Equestrian reaction."

thoraxian.25.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]This morning [GetDateText] [CCN.GetLeader] was crowned ruler of the Olenian-Changeling Commonwealth.

Three hours later they went forth from the coronation event, amid the greatest rejoicing, a crowned and consecrated Monarch. No such delight has hailed a Sovereign's Coronation before."
thoraxian.25.a:0 "Interesting..."
thoraxian.26.t:0 "The Keisarinna's Plan"
thoraxian.26.d:0 "Keisarinna Velvet's Plan for the settlement of northern Olenia is in full swing, and it is a great success, providing living space for many deer and changelings. The vast, empty Olenian lands can now finally be used to their full potential!"
thoraxian.26.a:0 "Fantastic!"
thoraxian.27.t:0 "The Assuttamien Plan Continues"
thoraxian.27.d:0 "The Kaiserin's plan continues at full speed. The various towns and villages dotted around northern Olenia have steadily expanded into larger and more prosperous communities. Roads and buildings are starting to cover the previously empty vastness of Olenia, and the economic potential of these regions continues to grow."
thoraxian.27.a:0 "Excellent!"
thoraxian.28.t:0 "The Assuttamien Plan Is Complete!"
thoraxian.28.d:0 "The final stages of the Assuttamien plan were completed in the last few weeks, and northern Olenia has truly started to transform. The many towns and villages covering the landscape are slowly merging into cities, and problems between the deer and changelings seem like distant memories to the inhabitants of the vast northern expanses of Olenia."
thoraxian.28.a:0 "Fantastic!"
thoraxian.29.t:0 "Olenian Civil War Intervention"
thoraxian.29.d:0 "After pledging our own support to Queen Velvet's cause, it's our time to shine, and bring back harmony by helping Velvet to take down Johan. Our forces stand ready, and willing to help Velvet reclaim her rightful place as the harmonious Queen."
thoraxian.35.t:0 "Changeling Demands"
thoraxian.35.d:0 "During a meeting with one of the ambassadors of the changelings, it was made clear to us that they expect us to hold a referendum for those "harmony" supporters soon. The UFPR has grown in popularity ever since the changelings started to cozy up to Equestria, and now command a significant amount of support from our citizens. If we accept the referendum we might open the door to further changeling interference in our government, but refusing might have other consequences."
thoraxian.35.a:0 "We have no choice, hold the referendum."
thoraxian.35.b:0 "We can't cave into changeling demands that easily!"
thoraxian.36.t:0 "The Bears Accept!"
thoraxian.36.d:0 "The polar bears have accepted our generous offer, and Harmony now reigns in the Polar Bear Communities. The UFPR has requested our aid in transitioning their society to truly embrace harmony, and who are we to refuse such an offer."
thoraxian.36.a:0 "Excellent!"
thoraxian.37.t:0 "The Bears Refuse!"
thoraxian.37.d:0 "It seems that our offer did not go over well with [PLB.GetLeader], and was rejected by the Polar bears. In an official statement, Paw said that further changeling interference in the politics of the Polar bear communities would not be tolerated. It seems we might have to take other measures to establish harmony in the Polar bear communities."
thoraxian.37.a:0 "An unwise decision on their part."
thoraxian.38.t:0 "An Offer From The Changelings"
thoraxian.38.d:0 "The changelings have recently started to pressure us to hold a referendum for the supporters of Harmony within Yakyakistan.[From.GetLeader] is wary of accepting the offer, as the changelings have established very close ties with the Yakitan Liberal Nam, and there is no telling what they might do after the referendum."
thoraxian.38.a:0 "We must accept."
thoraxian.38.b:0 "We will not bow to their demands."
thoraxian.39.t:0 "The Yaks Accept"
thoraxian.39.d:0 "Yakyakistan recently held a referendum for their harmony supporters, and our good friends the in the Yakitan Liberal Nam have come out on top. Naturally, we must provide aid to the Yaks, both economically and politically. "
thoraxian.39.a:0 "Fantastic news!"
thoraxian.40.t:0 "The Yaks Refuse"
thoraxian.40.d:0 "It seems that our demands did not go over well with [From.GetLeader], and our offer was rejected by Yakyakistan. After this small setback, it might be necessary to pursue other options in bringing harmony to the Yaks."
thoraxian.40.a:0 "Unfortunate."
thoraxian.41.t:0 "A Change of Doctrine"
thoraxian.41.d:0 "With the integration of Olenia as our partner, we now have two choices of military doctrine; theirs, or ours. While our forces, overall, make up a greater portion of the army, and thus, it would be far easier to restructure their army then to do so with ours, there is also the possibility of exploring our partner's doctrinal warplan. After all, the world has already seen our might and experience in the civil war which cast the tyrant Chrysalis down. What shall we go with?"
thoraxian.41.a:0 "The tried and tested! The Changeling way!"
thoraxian.41.b:0 "The deer's way of thinking holds interesting possibilities."
