CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Panzerkampfwagen III"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1005/1006, General Vect envisioned two basic tank types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future Changeling Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Panzerkampfwagen IV"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Stalliongradian T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed Changeling tank, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "Panzerkampfwagen V Panther"
CCN_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Panther is the common name of a medium tank deployed by Changelings from mid-1014. It was intended as a counter to the Stalliongradian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside the heavier Tiger tank. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks ever created."

Thorax and his supporters, as well as numerous detractors of Chrysalis, have all united under the banner of 'harmony'.\n\nNumerous hives in Volistad, Antax, and Soryth have pledged their allegiance to Thorax, embracing the values of harmony, friendship, and peace."

Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole.

PT_CCN_queen_argynnis_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 975\n\n§YBiography§!: The martial hive of Vraks has always had a tenuous relationship with Vesalipolis, at best. The two had for centuries engaged in skirmishes and raids before Vraks attacked the other hive with full force but was repelled by Chrysalis and her allies from Ditrysium. In 971 Chrysalis struck back with an expanded alliance and crushed Vraks, whose Queen committed suicide rather than face Chrysalis' wrath. Her oldest hatchling, Argynnis, thus became Queen. She holds no grudge against Chrysalis and recognizes her might, but never skips an opportunity to make a mocking, sarcastic comment if she fails."
PT_CCN_queen_yaria_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 969\n\n§YBiography§!: Queen of the largest northern hive of Soryth, which lies on the shore of the Key Lake. The Key Lake is known for its concentration of magical energy. Magic helped changelings of Soryth to survive harsh northern weather for generations. Queen Yaria believes that thorough study of magical abilities of crystals is vital for future success of the changeling nation. She is one of the queens who joined Chrysalis voluntarily and genuinely believes she can lead their race to greatness. In her eyes, changelings have the same potential for magic abilities as unicorns, if they only develop it enough."
PT_CCN_queen_aurantia_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 957\n\n§YBiography§!: The aging queen of the industrial hive-city of Lyctida is able to provide resources and lumber for our railroads and military equipment. Ever since Chrysalis lead her alliance to save Lyctida from marauding deer zealots, she has been her most loyal supporter. She always strives to earn Chrysalis' favour, but she in turn sees Aurantia as a useful and reliable pawn until she eventually dies from old age."
PT_CCN_queen_helvia_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 970\n\n§YBiography§!: The young queen of the thriving port hive of Ditrysium is interested in commercial expansion and increase of naval production. While Ditrysium was the first major hive to ally Vesalipolis, Helvia is not as fond of Chrysalis as her predecessor. The debacle of 1002 eventually led to communist sailors rioting in Ditrysium and Chrysalis crushed the resistance personally without asking Helvia. However, she is pragmatic and knows maintaining good relations with Vesalipolis is ultimately a positive thing."

PT_CCN_queendom_vraks_desc: "For the longest time Vraks and Vesalipolis have been rivals on the battlefield. For centuries, the changelings of Vraks have fought against their bigger northern neighbour with all their might. Sensing weakness in Queen Chrysalis, the hive led a full on assault on her home, which was only barely beaten back by the Queen. Years later, Vraks would be humiliated and finally put down and Vesalipolis would become the changeling metropole. The Vrakkians have now accepted the hegemony of Chrysalis, accepting her strength and excited to battle new enemies."
PT_CCN_queendom_soryth_desc: "Far to the northeast, on the shores of the Key Lake, Soryth stretches out. The sprawling hive is built in what the changelings would consider a non-crowded way, but for other creatures, even Soryth might feel cramped still. Key Lake is the reason why so many changelings endure the cold winters of the north of Equus and it is the city's most valuable resource. For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water."
PT_CCN_queendom_lyctida_desc: "The Hive of Lyctida lies in the middle of thick forests, and with the smoke from factories and lumber mills, the city is always a bit dark and at night, the moon and stars have difficulty illuminating the Black Hive. Lyctida is a sombre place, but for many changelings, it is still home. The hivelings are bugs of few words, preferring the company of machinery or the solitude of the forests. With the streets silent, the scenery drab and the company stoic, Lyctida receives few visitors."
PT_CCN_queendom_distryum_desc: "The Hive of Ditrysium was one of the first to ally with Vesalipolis when the hives were being unified, which paid of immensely for the port city. It is located at the far end of a protective fjord, allowing ships natural shelter from the elements. As one of the major commercial hubs for the changelings, Ditrysium is the link of the Changeling Lands to the outside world. It is also where the changelings are preparing their advancements in naval warfare. Drones buzz endlessly around the dry-docks to manufacture warships for the hives. "
