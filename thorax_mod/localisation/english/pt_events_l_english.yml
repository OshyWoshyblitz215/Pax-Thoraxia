PT_CCN_allies.17.d:0 "Gold Muffin wasn't sure of Thorax and his ideas how to take care of the nation. Really the only things politically they had in common was their hatred for Queen Chrysalis. But Gold Muffin knew he would need allies to stay alive, even Thorax, weak as he was, could tear down his warlord state. So he finally agreed upon meeting with him.\nHe entered the main governing building of this northern city where he was supposed to meet Thorax. He didn't know if Thorax would even take him seriously. But he was surprised to find that Thorax had shown up and said, "I need allies, and ones that are untied in a common cause. You fit my needs." "How will you help me?", responded Gold Muffin. Thorax retorted by saying, "You need allies to stay alive, and I can provide that." Gold Muffin thought about that fir a moment, and said "What will happen to me if you succeed?" "I was hoping you would become governor of Ditrysium." Gold Muffin didn't know how to respond to this, would Thorax really trust him with such a position? He finally manged to say "Do you really trust me with such a position?" "Well I was hoping to convince you to my way thought."\nGold Muffin knew this was coming, and he really never liked democracy, but he might as well see what he had to say. "Democracy allows anyling to vote for who they want to rule, thus making sure that everyling has who they want in power."  "But aren't commonlings, a little, not best suited to choose wh to rule them?" It looked as though Thorax had seen this coming, "There have been multiple cases of a functional free democracies, the River Republic has bee running a functional for decades." Gold Muffin still wasn't convinced, "What if I want to still be power if the changelings vote me out?" Thorax responded by saying "Make good decisions that benefit the changelings you rule over and they won't vote you out".\nThe conversation continued on for quite some time, but\neventually Thorax left, leaving Gold Muffin to think about what Thorax had said. He thought to himself, "Thorax made some good points." While Gold Muffin wasn't entirely convinced on democracy, he thought he should use some of the Thorax had told him about."
