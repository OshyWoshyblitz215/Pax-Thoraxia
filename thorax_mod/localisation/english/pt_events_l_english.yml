PT_CCN_allies.1.t:0 "The queen of Vraks"
PT_CCN_allies.1.d:0 "Vraks, a bustling city with millions of changelings and fortified to the brim, but more importantly to Thorax, the closest to Vesalipolis. Thorax looking at the high rise thought himself how good Queen Argynnis had done with it since the last time he had seen it. But he could not dwell in its bustling center for someone might recognize him and send him to certain death.\nHe entered a small, somewhat rundown building on the outskirts of town. Thorax recited his argument for joining him one more time in his head, and walked into the basement. While walking down the stairs he thought to himself, "Why did she agree to this?"\nHe opened the door and entered the small, dingy, and dark room. It was only illuminated by one light bulb, with which he could faintly see Queen Argynnis. Queen Argynnis began the conversation, "Thorax, let me make this short, I have no intention of staying with with Chrysalis." Thorax was blown away by this, would it really be this easy or was a trap? "I- U- Wha- Why?" Said Thorax. "Chrysalis is driving my mother to suicide and I believe is trying to remove me from Vraks."\nThorax responded with "I-Is that really it?" Argynnis tooka deep breath and said "No, the south will not go with me and I can't convince them. However, I think you can." Thorax thought about it for a second, then said "I believe I may be able to do it."\nThorax turned around and was about to leave when Argynnis said one more thing "However" she sighed "If you are unable to convince the south I can't join you as Vraks, even with its advanced fortifications, can't survive a siege from all sides." Thorax nodded and left the basement feeling better and worse off than before."
PT_CCN_allies.1.a:0 "The race for the south begins."
PT_CCN_allies.2.t:0 "Letter from Soryth"
PT_CCN_allies.2.d:0 "Thorax was being escorted through the storage room by a captain. He listened as the captain explained how many supplies the base had. As the captain was going over the base’s ammunition a Changeling courier ran around the corner and ran towards the two. Out of habit the captain drew his pistol but quickly lowered it as he saw the couriers badge. The courier quickly gave Thorax a letter before running off. Thorax saw the letter had the seal of Soryth on it and grinned. He knew the Hive was leaning his way, and he hoped this was confirmation the queen would side with him.\nAs Thorax quickly opened the letter, the captain watched him silently, before noticing some fighters grabbing a box of rifles. He ran over to help them, leaving Thorax alone. Thorax read the letter which he quickly confirmed was from Queen Yaria. She thanked him for his diplomatic efforts in ending Gold Muffins disruptions of her research. The Queen then pledged her support to Thorax, believing he would be better than Chrysalis.\nYes! Another queen on his side, and this one was an important one too. He quickly went to his office, making a beeline there as he thought about what to write in reply to the northern queen."

PT_CCN_allies.3.t:0 "Letter from Lyctida"
PT_CCN_allies.3.d:0 "Thorax was sitting at his rickety old desk, reading reports from Harmonist cells across the Changeling lands. He was already in a little bit of a bad mood, all of them were reporting some issue, whether it be supply issues, a resurgence in anti-Thoraxian propaganda or a large increase in garrisons. Some did not even report at all. Overall, outside of pro-Harmonist areas, the rebellion was being strangled in its infancy. At least the Queens seemed supportive, Chrysalis was a common enemy. His reading was interrupted by a banging on his door. Thorax sighed, who knew leading a rebellion would be so much work. He picked up a pistol he always carried, just in case, and opened the door a crack, once he confirmed it was one of his messengers he opened it fully and accepted the sealed envelope before the messenger scurried off. He sat back at his desk and looked at the seal and couldn't help but get a small grin. A message from Queen Aurantia of Lyctida. Perfect!\nThorax opened the letter quickly and read it… disappointment. It was just flowery language thanking him for his letter and then asking him to surrender to Chrysalis and her vast armies for the good of the changeling race, blah blah blah. He hissed and shoved the letter back into the envelope and burned them with his magic. However, the envelope didn't burn, well, not the entire envelope. The outer layer burned to reveal a letter hidden via magic. What was this?\nHe carefully picked up the new letter, it was cool to the touch, some kind of anti-fire magic? He read it carefully. It was from… Princess Aurantia II… The granddaughter and current heir of Lyctida Hive after her mother died in the Olenian invasion. She commended Thorax on finding her hidden letter, she brought reports from her Hive, how her grandmother was being manipulated by Chrysalis sympathizers, how Chrysalis was destroying Lyctida culture and working the Drones near to death. How her grandmother believed that Chrysalis was the only thing keeping Olenia from slaughtering her hive. The Princess expressed that she had to seize power back to Lyctida and was willing to aid Thorax in his cause if he sent her aid and gave her time she would need to coup Chrysalian cronies.\nThorax was grinning again. While it would have been preferable to get direct aid from Lyctida, this would do. He immediately started to pen a letter back to Queen Aurantia, he also penned a second letter to his cell in Lyctida, a letter that would go directly to the princess, telling her she had support and that he welcomed working with her in the future."
PT_CCN_allies.3.a:0 "At least there was a little good news."
PT_CCN_allies.4.t:0 "Letter from Ditrysium"
PT_CCN_allies.4.d:0 "Thorax was in his room, sitting on his cot and looking at the map of the changeling lands. He kept it updated daily, and he was happy, today had been a good day. Reports had come in about a large influx of changeling volunteers in Phantine, something had happened and many were turning away from Chrysalis. Many cells were strengthened with supplies and knowledge. They still couldn't do much but it was at least nice to know that he had supporters.\nA common sound for him interrupted his thoughts, a knock on his door. Once more picking up his pistol the rebel leader cracked it open a bit. A messenger, with a letter. Thorax grabbed it and before he could thank the messenger they had run off. He brought the letter inside and smiled. It was a reply from queen Helvia of Ditrysium, the naval hive of the changelings. He ripped it open and read it.\nThe letter was pure vitriol, cursing Thorax and his little rebellion. But what came next though struck Thorax to his core. Helvia revealed that she knew of Thoraxs little friends in Olenia, and changelings and ships were already being sent to warn king Johan and stop any aid from reaching the Thoraxians.\nThorax punched his wall, only to hurt himself. Owww, those log walls were sturdy. He sighed and threw the letter in the trash, thinking it would not even be worth burning. He put his head in his hooves."
PT_CCN_allies.4.a:0 "Another set back, and just when things were going well."
PT_CCN_allies.5.t:0 "The revolutionary"
PT_CCN_allies.5.d:0 "Gold Muffin wasn't sure of Thorax and his ideas how to take care of the nation. Really the only things politically they had in common was their hatred for Queen Chrysalis. But Gold Muffin knew he would need allies to stay alive, even Thorax, weak as he was, could tear down his warlord state. So he finally agreed upon meeting with him.\nHe entered the main governing building of this northern city where he was supposed to meet Thorax. He didn't know if Thorax would even take him seriously. But he was surprised to find that Thorax had shown up and said, "I need allies, and ones that are untied in a common cause. You fit my needs." "How will you help me?", responded Gold Muffin. Thorax retorted by saying, "You need allies to stay alive, and I can provide that." Gold Muffin thought about that fir a moment, and said "What will happen to me if you succeed?" "I was hoping you would become governor of Ditrysium." Gold Muffin didn't know how to respond to this, would Thorax really trust him with such a position? He finally manged to say "Do you really trust me with such a position?" "Well I was hoping to convince you to my way thought."\nGold Muffin knew this was coming, and he really never liked democracy, but he might as well see what he had to say. "Democracy allows anyling to vote for who they want to rule, thus making sure that everyling has who they want in power."  "But aren't commonlings, a little, not best suited to choose wh to rule them?" It looked as though Thorax had seen this coming, "There have been multiple cases of a functional free democracies, the River Republic has bee running a functional for decades." Gold Muffin still wasn't convinced, "What if I want to still be power if the changelings vote me out?" Thorax responded by saying "Make good decisions that benefit the changelings you rule over and they won't vote you out".\nThe conversation continued on for quite some time, but\neventually Thorax left, leaving Gold Muffin to think about what Thorax had said. He thought to himself, "Thorax made some good points." While Gold Muffin wasn't entirely convinced on democracy, he thought he should use some of the Thorax had told him about."
