PT_CCN_allies.1.t:0 "A Letter from Vraks"
PT_CCN_allies.1.d:0 "Thorax was outside for the first time in a while. He closed his eyes and breathed in slowly, enjoying the chirping of the birds. He relaxed and opened his eyes and looked out into the forest. His break was unfortunately interrupted by a courier.m Thorax turned towards the Changeling, before he could speak the changeling thrust a scroll into his face. Which Thorax instinctively caught with his own magic. Then the courier was gone. Thorax shakes his head, the changeling was probably busy.\nHe opened the letter after a cursory scan with his magic. He also got a peek at the seal of Vraks. As he read it he grinned but then a frown started to grow. Queen Argynnis had agreed to aid his “little rebellion” However she also stated unequivocally how she wanted to not be ruled over. Vraks was an important hive, one that had considerable military experience. But if she would not join his nation afterwards.. Well that would be a problem. He sighed, at least it sounded like she was open to having autonomy. He folded up the letter and turned back towards the main building, it was now time to draft a return letter."
PT_CCN_allies.1.a:0 "Here is what I got..."
PT_CCN_allies.2.t:0 "Letter from Soryth"
PT_CCN_allies.2.d:0 "Thorax was being escorted through the storage room by a captain. He listened as the captain explained how many supplies the base had. As the captain was going over the bases ammunition a Changeling courier ran around the corner and ran towards the two. Out of habit the captain drew his pistol but quickly lowered it as he saw the couriers badge. The courier quickly gave Thorax a letter before running off. Thorax saw the letter had the seal of Soryth on it and grinned. He knew the Hive was leaning his way, and he hoped this was confirmation the queen would side with him.\nAs Thorax quickly opened the letter, the captain watched him silently, before noticing some fighters grabbing a box of rifles. He ran over to help them, leaving Thorax alone. Thorax read the letter which he quickly confirmed was from Queen Yaria. She thanked him for his diplomatic efforts in ending Gold Muffins disruptions of her research. The Queen then pledged her support to Thorax, believing he would be better than Chrysalis.\nYes! Another queen on his side, and this one was an important one too. He quickly went to his office, making a beeline there as he thought about what to write in reply to the northern queen."

PT_CCN_allies.3.t:0 "Letter from Lyctida"
PT_CCN_allies.3.d:0 "Thorax was sitting at his rickety old desk, reading reports from Harmonist cells across the Changeling lands. He was already in a little bit of a bad mood, all of them were reporting some issue, whether it be supply issues, a resurgence in anti-Thoraxian propaganda or a large increase in garrisons. Some did not even report at all. Overall, outside of pro-Harmonist areas, the rebellion was being strangled in its infancy. At least the Queens seemed supportive, Chrysalis was a common enemy. His reading was interrupted by a banging on his door. Thorax sighed, who knew leading a rebellion would be so much work. He picked up a pistol he always carried, just in case, and opened the door a crack, once he confirmed it was one of his messengers he opened it fully and accepted the sealed envelope before the messenger scurried off. He sat back at his desk and looked at the seal and couldn't help but get a small grin. A message from Queen Aurantia of Lyctida. Perfect!\nThorax opened the letter quickly and read it… disappointment. It was just flowery language thanking him for his letter and then asking him to surrender to Chrysalis and her vast armies for the good of the changeling race, blah blah blah. He hissed and shoved the letter back into the envelope and burned them with his magic. However, the envelope didn't burn, well, not the entire envelope. The outer layer burned to reveal a letter hidden via magic. What was this?\nHe carefully picked up the new letter, it was cool to the touch, some kind of anti-fire magic? He read it carefully. It was from… Princess Aurantia II… The granddaughter and current heir of Lyctida Hive after her mother died in the Olenian invasion. She commended Thorax on finding her hidden letter, she brought reports from her Hive, how her grandmother was being manipulated by Chrysalis sympathizers, how Chrysalis was destroying Lyctida culture and working the Drones near to death. How her grandmother believed that Chrysalis was the only thing keeping Olenia from slaughtering her hive. The Princess expressed that she had to seize power back to Lyctida and was willing to aid Thorax in his cause if he sent her aid and gave her time she would need to coup Chrysalian cronies.\nThorax was grinning again. While it would have been preferable to get direct aid from Lyctida, this would do. He immediately started to pen a letter back to Queen Aurantia, he also penned a second letter to his cell in Lyctida, a letter that would go directly to the princess, telling her she had support and that he welcomed working with her in the future."
PT_CCN_allies.3.a:0 "At least there was a little good news."
PT_CCN_allies.4.t:0 "Letter from Ditrysium"
PT_CCN_allies.4.d:0 "Thorax was in his room, sitting on his cot and looking at the map of the changeling lands. He kept it updated daily, and he was happy, today had been a good day. Reports had come in about a large influx of changeling volunteers in Phantine, something had happened and many were turning away from Chrysalis. Many cells were strengthened with supplies and knowledge. They still couldn't do much but it was at least nice to know that he had supporters.\nA common sound for him interrupted his thoughts, a knock on his door. Once more picking up his pistol the rebel leader cracked it open a bit. A messenger, with a letter. Thorax grabbed it and before he could thank the messenger they had run off. He brought the letter inside and smiled. It was a reply from queen Helvia of Ditrysium, the naval hive of the changelings. He ripped it open and read it.\nThe letter was pure vitriol, cursing Thorax and his little rebellion. But what came next though struck Thorax to his core. Helvia revealed that she knew of Thoraxs little friends in Olenia, and changelings and ships were already being sent to warn king Johan and stop any aid from reaching the Thoraxians.\nThorax punched his wall, only to hurt himself. Owww, those log walls were sturdy. He sighed and threw the letter in the trash, thinking it would not even be worth burning. He put his head in his hooves."
PT_CCN_allies.4.a:0 "Another set back, and just when things were going well."
PT_CCN_allies.5.t:0 "The revolutionary"
PT_CCN_allies.5.d:0 "Gold Muffin wasn't sure of Thorax and his ideas how to take care of the nation. Really the only things politically they had in common was their hatred for Queen Chrysalis. But Gold Muffin knew he would need allies to stay alive, even Thorax, weak as he was, could tear down his warlord state. So he finally agreed upon meeting with him.\nHe entered the main governing building of this northern city where he was supposed to meet Thorax. He didn't know if Thorax would even take him seriously. But he was surprised to find that Thorax had shown up and said, "I need allies, and ones that are untied in a common cause. You fit my needs." "How will you help me?", responded Gold Muffin. Thorax retorted by saying, "You need allies to stay alive, and I can provide that." Gold Muffin thought about that fir a moment, and said "What will happen to me if you succeed?" "I was hoping you would become governor of Ditrysium." Gold Muffin didn't know how to respond to this, would Thorax really trust him with such a position? He finally manged to say "Do you really trust me with such a position?" "Well I was hoping to convince you to my way thought."\nGold Muffin knew this was coming, and he really never liked democracy, but he might as well see what he had to say. "Democracy allows anyling to vote for who they want to rule, thus making sure that everyling has who they want in power."  "But aren't commonlings, a little, not best suited to choose wh to rule them?" It looked as though Thorax had seen this coming, "There have been multiple cases of a functional free democracies, the River Republic has bee running a functional for decades." Gold Muffin still wasn't convinced, "What if I want to still be power if the changelings vote me out?" Thorax responded by saying "Make good decisions that benefit the changelings you rule over and they won't vote you out".\nThe conversation continued on for quite some time, but\neventually Thorax left, leaving Gold Muffin to think about what Thorax had said. He thought to himself, "Thorax made some good points." While Gold Muffin wasn't entirely convinced on democracy, he thought he should use some of the Thorax had told him about."
PT_CCN_allies.5.a:0 ""Thorax may not be that bad.""
PT_CCN_allies.6.t:0 "Wehrmacht Defections"
PT_CCN_allies.6.d:0 "Thorax sat in his makeshift bedroom/office. Laid out on his desk were various reports.\nA map sat in the middle of his desk displaying troop movements. So far, the lines were holding, much to his surprise. If he could get more troops. \nThorax wasn’t a military bug. These decisions were better served in the hooves of his commanders. His job was everything else. He briefly wondered what he could do about Lycitda; its’ fall would put his right on Chrysalis’ doorstep and make her divert troops away from Vraks and towards protecting the capital.\nA knock resounded through the makeshift office that was once a bedroom disrupting his thought process.\n“Enter,” Thorax looked up as a Changeling, one of his advisors.\n“Sir, we have received word from various generals from the Wehrmacht. They are rallying to our cause,” the advisor said.\nThorax smiled. “Well, there’s some good news,” he replied, getting up and coming around his desk.\n“When will they arrive?” Thorax asked.\n“A few delivered their defection in person, sir. They are waiting in the meeting room.”"

PT_CCN_allies.7.d:0 "We heard message via letter. Its from Queen Helvia of Ditrysium! She told us she no longer thinks Chrysalis has much of a chance to win the war.

PT_CCN_allies.9.d:0 "We have heard news that the Princess Aurantia the II and local young Queen Avia have finally launch their full rebellion on Queendom of Lycidta! This will destabilize their homefront for the Chrysalis’s war effort in the civil war. We hope they can hold on."
PT_CCN_allies.9.a:0 "For Harmony!"
PT_CCN_allies.10.t:0 "The Sea Queen switched sides!"
PT_CCN_allies.10.d:0 "More terrible news! It appears Queen Helvia of Ditrysium is doubting our chances of success! She has decided to side with Thorax! We have lost a significant ally in this war, and lost our control over the sea. We hope we can recover from this…"
PT_CCN_allies.10.a:0 "By gods! Why has she betrayed me?"
PT_CCN_allies.13.t:0 "A Brotherly Reunion"
PT_CCN_allies.13.d:0 "Thorax was reading the files of the defected generals at his desk when all of a sudden, a knock came at the door.\nIt's instinct that makes him hold his pistol and speak up. “Greetings, I'm a little busy here... talk to me later.” Thorax replied with a firm tone.\n“Awwww…. Is there no time to see his little brother?” He heard a familiar voice, which made him turn around, open the door immediately, and saw Pharynx, his big brother.\nThorax couldn’t hold back his tears and hugs him tightly. “Oh Pharynx! You’re here! I couldn’t believe that you're here!” \nPharynx rolled his eyes and chuckles. “Well when i come to choose either the bitchy queen or my caring brother… the answer is obvious…” Pharynx smirks, hiding his pain and whiplashes behind his brother…\nThorax wipes his tears away. “I’m very gald youre here!” he looks behind and saw a shy yellow eyed Changeling officer wearing a reading glasses. “And who is she?” he asked.\nPharynx wraps his hoof to officer’s back which made her face red. “This beautiful butterfly is Yanna Chitin! My liutenant and my no.1 assistant” Yanna fixed her glasses and nods, not a single word coming from her.\n“So um only you two came to assist our war effort?” Thorax asked, he remembered that the war is still not yet over. Pharynx laughs. “Of course brother! I brought my entire legion that are loyal to me and ready to fight for your cause!”\nWith this Thorax smiled at his brother, with these new troops coming to fight for his struggle, their fortunes may finally change the course of the war."

PT_CHN.10.d:0 "Yaria was, to put it lightly, furious. Her hard work, the obelisks which could make changeling magic far more powerful than Equestrian magic, were stolen by some Communists for the gold that was in them. Even worse, the Wehrmacht could've very easily stopped them, but had not because the commander had been asleep. “What an idiotic reason”, she thought. Now a year or more worth of her hard work was gone because of some fat, lazy general. This would not go unpunished.\n"AND YOU JUST LET THEM GO?", she screamed as he entered her office.\nThe commander calmly responded "Well, we couldn't tell if they were friendly or n-"\nShe cut him off: "YOU CANT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMUNIST PARTISAN AND A WEHRMACHT SOLDIER?"\nThe commander, somehow still very calm, replied: "Madam, don't you think you're over reacting?"\n"I AM NOT OVERREAC-"\nshe breathed in slightly and said:\n"You are dismissed from your position, leave now."\nThe commander left the room, unimaginably still calm. Yaria sat down in her chair, her throat sore from all that yelling. She would have to start on her research again soon. But first she needed to write to Chrysalis to reform the Wehrmacht, which was clearly rotten from the inside out.\n"To Queen Chrysalis, The Wehrmacht is in dire need reform, as the commander put in charge of the protection of my research was completely and utterly incompetent at protecting my research from a communist attack. That's why I request that you allow the Queens to assign our preferred commanders to important positions.\n From Queen Yaria of Soryth.""

"Answer my question, how could you have known who was a communist, and how many did you kill?"\nHe thought for a moment, and then said:\n"We killed only as many as we needed to."\nThis wasn't going anywhere, and besides, even if she did get answers, this wasn't going to bring back those who were killed.\n"House arrest, bare minimum love ration, no contact with his troops."\nShe would have to write a letter to Chrysalis, allowing the Wehrmacht this much power would not do if the Communists were to be destroyed.\n"To Queen Chrysalis, I request that you remove the powers that the Wehrmacht has over the ability to purge massive amount amounts of changelings and put all armed forces under the complete authority of the Queens. The local Wehrmacht has recently purged possibly over 2,000 changelings, thus the power of the Wehrmacht should be reduced.\n From Queen Hevia “"
PT_CHN.11.a:0 "The Wehrmacht seems to be quite imperfect..."
PT_CHN.12.t:0 "No rest, even in old age."
PT_CHN.12.d:0 "\nIt was a warm sunny day in the city of Lycitda. The Queen stood in her garden and took a breath of fresh air.\nIt was always a blessing to step away from the constraints of ruling the hive and have some personal time. No advisor to tell her the latest doomsday incident, no paperwork for her to drown in, and no complaining nobles.\nThe gardens never failed to help Aurantia think; today, she needed to think long and hard.\nReports were coming from all over her city of VOPS operatives performing anti-Thoraxian operations. A few days prior, an Oberst from the Heer came into her throne room and demanded billets for himself and his troops. Of course, she was all too willing to help the heroes of the hive and provide them with whatever they needed. \nQuite a few of them were Lycitdians. She, of course, demanded he shares whatever information he was allowed to give. In short, the Oberst was pleasant and shared his mission with her over a cup of tea.\nFortunately, she put forth a very pro-Chrysalian agenda, and very few Lycitdians were hurt in the ensuing roundup. \nJust like their queen, they were all too willing to comply. It was for the greater good, after all.\nThat’s not what pressed on the Queen's mind, however. It was what was happening in other parts of the country. Just last week, the Heer killed two-thousand lings in one setting Aurantia had made it very clear to the Oberst in command of her operation that loyal or not, something that large was unacceptable in Lycitda.\nAurantia was concerned not for the country but her own hive. Chrysalis was good for the Changelings as a race, but she has to put her hive before racial heritage at some point. \nShe walked further into the garden as if to get as lost as possible. She smiled, surrounded by a grove of lilies, roses, lilacs, and lavender. \n“My Queen!” Someling called from nearby.\nSo much for personal time.\n“In here,” she replied, turning her attention to the advisor who came looking for her.\nWith her advisor was also a second Changeling wearing the black uniform of the Queen's Guard, specifically Chrysalis’s guard, as seen by the insignias on his uniform.\n“My Queen, dispatch straight from her most esteemed majesty Queen Chrysalis for you,” the guardsling bowed out of respect, reaching into his saddlebag and retrieving a sealed envelope.\nThe Queen smiled and took the envelope. “You are dismissed, and please give the Queen my regards.”\nThe guardsling nodded and gave a curt bow once more before departing, most likely back to Vesalipolis.\n“You are dismissed as well, Hopper,” Aurantia said over her shoulder to her advisor.\n“Thank you, my Queen,” he bowed before returning to his duties.\nWith her peace back, she turned her attention to the letter and opened it.\nAs she read the letter, she sighed."

PT_CHN.13.t:0 "Friend to the end"
PT_CHN.13.d:0 "Queen Argynnis sits on the floor in her palace. In front of her, suspended in her reddish-brown aura, is the head of her close friend Ermonyx Conliealdae who lay lifeless on the floor, stabbed through the chest, his heart being sliced in half almost instantly.\nHe had died within minutes, and the Queen was powerless to save him. She released him and wrapped him in her hooves. She didn’t care that the green blood began seeping into her robe, nor did she care about the tears that flowed from her eyes as they fell.\nThe blade used was dropped nearby with a splatter of green dripping onto the polished floors. The assassin since fled with a group of guards in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, the Queen remained in her protective embrace of the Ling she called a friend for so many years.\n“Why…” She stammered, holding the body tight.\nHer physician came to a halt from a brisk trot carrying his medical bag in his aura. The doctor set it down and sighed. He already knew he was too late.\n“My Queen…” He started slightly pulling on her robe. She didn’t move but became aware of his presence.\n“You need to let him go,” her doctor stated in a soft, sympathetic tone. Argynnis wanted to scream, have that irritating doctor put to death on the spot for his sudden insolence.\n “How dare he give me an order!” she thought before turning her head to face him. However, she couldn’t bring herself to scowl, only look into his sympathetic gaze with her sorrowful expression. Her anger melted away, and she respectfully rested Ermonyx on the floor and stepped away.\n”Who would do such a thing?” Was the first thing that went through her mind.\nArgynnis continued to watch for what felt like hours as the doctor at least attempted to revive her friend. Everyling knew how fruitless his efforts were. It seems he did, too, which is why he stopped after three rounds of CPR.\n“My Queen,” one of her guards called out to her driving her from her stupor. The guard, clad in his dark green uniform and Stahlhelm, marched back and held in a pair of hoof cuffs. Being dragged beside him was the Ling. Argynnis’s anger began to boil at the disgusting worm that took away her friend. The Changeling bore the colors of the Vesalipolis hive. She hated the enemy, and it didn’t take Argynnis long to figure out who the culprit was.\nBut she had to make sure before she dug a hole she couldn’t get out of. “You!” Argynnis roared, marching up to the Changeling, who stood firm. As she got closer, his resolve began to fail him as small traces of fear began to show on his ugly despicable face. Argynnis wanted desperately to rip said face off and flay the Ling alive. Argynnis knew that action would have negative consequences, but this Ling was one of Chrysalis’s agents, she just knew it, but she had to prove it.n“Search him,” she ordered.Her guards systematically began going through any pocket he might have in his jacket, however, didn’t find anything. Argynnis had time to figure this out. For now, this Ling was a simple murderer, and until she could tie him to espionage, it would have to do.\n“Take him to the dungeon, bare minimum love ration, no food,” Argynnis spat at the Ling.\nHer guards swiftly dragged him away, and Argynnis turned back to Ermonyx as the doctor placed a sheet over the body. Argynnis was going to do this the right way, if not for herself, then for her dear friend. He deserved it.\nArgynnis knew Queen Chrysalis was behind this, and she would prove it. That vile snake would burn at the tip of her sword for this."

Why was this happening?\nDeep down, she knew it was that traitor. Thorax was poisoning the well with his infectious thoughts of friendship and harmony.\nChrysalis knew there was only one option to solve this issue without bloodshed, but it was still a gamble.\nShe grabbed a pen and paper and began writing.\n\nChrysalis was going to gather the Queens, and maybe she could save what she had built.\n\n‘Dear Queen Argynnis’ The first letter started."

PT_CHN.15.t:0 "The Queens' demands"
PT_CHN.15.d:0 "One month later, Imperial Palace, Vesalipolis.\nQueen Chrysalis sat at the end of the mahogany table with her Imperial seal etched into the wood. Her white visor cap lay facing her on the table. In front of her sat the four Queens in a circle around the table.\nThe Queen regarded them each for a moment before speaking.\n“Welcome to Vesalipolis. I hope your trip was relatively painless,” Chrysalis began with a cordial tone.\nThe first to speak was Queen Helvia of Ditrysium. “Could have gone better,” she looked distrustfully at the Queen.\nArgynnis nodded in agreement but remained silent.\nChrysalis then took out each letter and placed them on the table. “So, I can see you have some “demands.” I gathered us here today to discuss these demands in greater detail.”\nShe looked around at each Queen, and they each nodded in agreement.\n“The Wehrmacht and VOPS are out of control, Chrysalis. Those changelings didn’t need to be slaughtered. There had to be a better way,” Helvia started them off.\n“I agree,” Yaria said, looking expectantly at Chrysalis.\n“Your agents are out of control. My best researcher was killed by your VOPS agents simply for being suspected of collaborating with the Thoraxians. My research has been set back months, maybe even years.” Yaria flicked her mane away from her eyes. Her annoyance was radiant.\nChrysalis huffed in minor irritation but couldn’t deny the importance of Yaria’s research.\nOf course, it was VOPS. VOPS was always creating problems. Chrysalis had half a mind to purge the agency and start fresh, but that would only set her plans back.\n“It is regrettable, and perhaps a lot of this could have been avoided. VOPS and the Wehrmacht are only doing what they need to do to eliminate the Thoraxian threat. The only thing I can promise is that I will launch an investigation into these matters, and proper punishments will be implemented,” Chrysalis started the diplomatic approach. Perhaps if she gave them some hope, it would buy her some time, but it seemed they weren’t satisfied."

They fester and wish to make the hives Queenless!” Yaria rebuked, earning a nod of approval from Helvia.\n“It seems it’s all coming apart at the seams. That’s too bad.” Argynnis piped up.\n“Argynnis, if you don’t have anything productive to put in, then don’t say it,” Aurantia scolded.\nChrysalis eyed Argynnis, who returned the gaze with a look of mirth.\n“I’m just pointing out the obvious, my dear Aurantia,” Argynnis chuckled to herself.\nChrysalis furrowed her brow. “And just what is that supposed to mean?” She rebuked.\n“I really have to spell it out for you? You really must not see what’s in front of you,” Argynnis continued to tease.\n“Out with it, Argynnis!” Chrysalis snapped.\nThis little girl had the gall to make fun of her in her own castle.\n“Fine, I guess I'll spell out for your tiny brain,” Argynnis laughed at how red in the face Chrysallis began to get. “You’re losing control of your government, and the only way you can maintain some semblance of control is through acts of violence,” Argynnis smirked.\nChrysallis growled.\n“I should have you shot for your impudence,” Unfortunately, Chrysalis realized what she was doing too late before the words could even leave her mouth.\n“Case in point, my fellow Queens, she’s lost all control over what is needed, so obsessed with her plans for revenge against Equestria and Princess Twilight.” Argynnis smirked. She had most definitely won this engagement.\nChrysalis sat down in her seat, mentally scolding herself for being so stupid with her words.\n“I’m sure she’s doing the best she can,” Aurantia made to Chrysalis’s defense.\n“How can you say that with the display we just saw, Aurantia? Open your eyes,” Helvia balked.\n“My eyes are wide open, Helvia. It’s all of you who lack any semblance of loyalty,” Aurantia reprimanded her fellow Queens.\n“How dare you!” Yaria stood up, slamming her hooves on the table.\nChrysalis sat in her seat, thinking as the table devolved into chaos.\n“How dare I? How dare you for not being there for the High Queen when she needs us the most!” Aurantia argued back, standing up to face the snow queen.\n“Aurantia, your loyalty is blind. If anything, you’re just as blind as her,” Argynnis argued calmly, sitting in her seat and gesturing to Chrysalis.\n“My loyalty was earned when she saved me and my hive from the Deer raiders. Without her, Lycitda wouldn’t exist today,” Aurantia snorted indignantly.\n“Enough!” Chrysalis suddenly jerked up and shouted to them.\n“What will you have me do? Tear apart all we have built?” Chrysalis admonished. The gazes returned and told her all she needed to know."

PT_CHN.17.d:0 "Chrysalis entered her private quarters and tossed her hat across the room in a rage.\nThose stupid little girls. How could they just throw away the greatness she had built?\nChrysalis grabbed her dresser and tossed it across the room, shattering various pots, glass ornaments, and tables, and subsequently threw them everywhere else too.\nShe heard a metallic clang sound in her rage, and she turned her head, and in the destruction laying on the floor was a helmet. She recognized it well, and she hadn’t worn it in years.\nShe walked over, picked it up in her green aura, and studied the shining pickelhaube. It was almost as shiny as it had been the day she left it on the pedestal that now lay ruined by her bed.\nHer rage subsided, replaced with just one thing, sorrow. The kind of sorrow of memories you cherished once. Chrysalis sat on her haunches and stared aimlessly at the helmet she had worn in many battles; it was her symbol for years from when her subjects loved her instead of fearing her presence. \nEveryling remembered the Iron Queen from a time when she led her armies across the land, uniting the Changelings under one flag.\n“When did it all go wrong?” Chrysalis thought out loud.\nNoling said or heard anything when she pressed the helmet to her chest. Not even when a deep sigh was followed by the quiet sobs, and absolutely noling saw the tears that followed."

It seems that a large number of their sympathizers in the rest of the country have chosen to follow them north\n The Queen of Gorak was brutally killed and Gold Muffin has conducted a speech proclaiming the so-called 'liberation' of the north, as well as calling for all changeling workers to unite against the Queen!"

PT_CHN.24.d:0 "Dear Chrysalis:\nTimes have been hard these recent months since your rule collapsed. Many of your lands have been taken by enemies and traitors from within our very own changeling race. It’s an absolute travesty! Do you remember those old times when you and I stood together and fought together for a united changeling homeland? That is the dream of every changeling who believes in the heritage of our great race – like worship of our strength, elegant traditions, and much more! I still believe in that dream, this nation. Though currently disunited, it will inevitably be united by the unstoppable tide of fate.\nThis is our shared homeland Chrysalis – and I won't just wait and see this once great nation fall into the hooves of those harmonists and red plebs and becomes an Equestrian puppet. Let’s work together like in the good old days, like when we were still young. Let’s unite this great country once again and once and for all!"

PT_CHN.25.d:0 "\nDear Chrysalis:\nIt seems like your little "Empire" is collapsing, doesn't it? And you know you can't beat all the traitors alone, so you come to seek my help? Look what you have done Chrysalis, the disunited nation which you united has collapsed again, all by your own design. United by you, collapsed by you. How Ironic.\nAlas, you call me and I’ll answer the call. Although I can assure you that Ditrysium will stand with you until the civil war finishes just like in the old times, but  you must assure me that after everything comes to an end, you will offer me a reward instead of a knife from the back.\nSo in this letter, let’s make everything clear before all start: my condition is that, after the civil war, Ditrysium should be provided more autonomy. Promise me this, and you will have my support and the support of all of Ditrysium. Understood? It’s not about stirring up any  opposition or meaning revenge – but at least now you will learn that the sons and daughters of Ditrysium will never do anything costing them their lives for nothing.\nRemember that you arrogant Queen.\nAnd undestand that the Changeling Lands aren't just city named Vesalipolis.
