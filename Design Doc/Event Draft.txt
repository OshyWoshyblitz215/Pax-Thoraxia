Thoraxian Events


Countrywide Raids Fail

    The raids against the Thoraxians have been an utter failure! It seems the harmonists have infiltrated our government and managed to get forewarning. Every place we raided was either empty or we faced strong resistance. Queen Chrysalis is already demanding someone’s head. 
    The even more unfortunate part is that it appears our raids have only galvanized local populations against us. We are receiving reports of increased hostility in our vassal states and Thoraxian propaganda has been rising.

“Damn those Thoraxians”

    Gold Muffin smiled as he sipped his brandy. He 


Friends from high and far.
Thorax was looking at the map of Changeling lands. He was in the process of planning his next attack when he was interrupted by a Changeling in a green beret saluting him. "Commander!" the soldier stated in the Changeling tongue. Thorax nodded and the soldier continued speaking.
“What is it?” 
Soldier catches his breath. "There are Ponies behind the tent and their leaders have requested your audience immediately!" He saluted before walking out of the tent. Thorax frowned lightly as he adjusted his beret and walked out. What reason did ponies have to come here?
The force was led by two familiar ponies and a dragon, each wearing uniforms similar to those he had seen in Stalliongrad alongside Crystal Pony engineers and volunteers. As soon as the ponies saw the changelings, they reached out to greet them. Those who led these expeditionary forces were the most surprising among all. From behind two unicorns, one light purple talking to the dragon and the other blue, wearing a stereotypical mage’s hat with a uniform that more resembles a suit rather than a khaki jacket. And in the middle is a small purple dragon wearing a cape with a snowflake emblem. As they recognize these ponies, Starlight and Trixie, Thorax smiles at them. When he was saved by them.
“Starlight! Trixie and Spike!” he called, hugging the three, they were surprised but quickly recovered and hugged him back.
“Hehehe well hello there! Commander Thorax” starlight grins as she hugs back. “How's your battle between good and evil?” she asked. “Meh… We're kinda hanging there..” Thorax answers though he frowns at Starlight calling his enemies evil.
“Well don't worry bud! We're here to help!” Spike exclaimed as Thorax stopped hugging them. “These Crystal ponies here are the Royal Frozen Butterfly Engineering Corp, these guys are expert Engineers! Right boys?!” Spike explained and called to the crystal ponies, who responded with mixtures of cheers and shouts of confirmation. 
Thorax grinned “We can always use Engineers.” The Engineers cheered again. Thorax turned to Spike, “How did you get these guys, I got a response from Cadence stating that she can’t spare any resources?” 
Spike nodded “Being the Hero of the Crystal Empire comes with some perks. These guys are all reserve engineers we figured they can help your rebellion.” Thorax was about to enquire on the Stalliongradians when Trixie stepped in between him and Spike. 
“And I Great and Powerful Trixie shall use my knowledge and magic that is unparalleled on the continent, nay the world, with my wonderful assistant Starlight Glimmer!” Trixie boasts, which starlight just rolled her eyes. “We are here to assist you in the battle against big bad evil changelings!”
Thorax grinned at her boasting but then frowned at her last words. He gestured to the group to follow him into his tent, once inside he spoke to them, “Please stop calling the Chrysalians all evil… Chrysalis may be an arrogant tyrant but most changelings are not evil.” Starlight and her group all nodded at his words.
“Regardless it is wonderful to have you three here, it is nice to see Celestia still can send help!” 
“Well technically we are not allowed to come here to help you” , Starlight stated.
Thorax tilts his head. “why??” he asked.
Starlight Sighs, “ is something about not being allowed to volunteer or something because of something about someone’s problems.”
Thorax looks confused “What does that mean?”
Spike replied. “Celestia senses that the politics of Equestria is in a difficult place right now, and sending ponies and money to a race that recently attacked Equestria does not look good for her.” Thorax nodded.
“Alright well, I am glad you guys came… So you got help from Stalliongrad?” Starlight chuckled as both Spike and Trixie looked amused. 
“Those ponies are former members of the Severyanan White Army, most of the white army left for Zebrica but some, many of whom joined our volunteer legion, stayed in Equestria.” Spike explained. A Severyanan came into the tent and nodded to the group.
“I apologize for overhearing… We are here to help you to save you from the tyranny of the Chrysalis hooves! We may have not saved our beloved motherland from the vile reds but we would not let other brave creatures be crushed by tyranny!” he said. Starlight nodded before asking him something in a foreign language. The Severyanan replied before going out of the tent. The rest of the group looked at her curiously.
“What? I know severyanan... so what?” The others shrugged. 
“Well Anyways. Thank you for joining me in this struggle… I appreciate it!” Thorax smiled.
“No problem!” Spike said, swishing his envoy’s cape. “ Now let's see our situation, Commander Thorax,” Starlight grinned confidently. 
Thorax nodded and gestured towards the map upon the table.

We have friends in high places = Crystal Empire Volunteer Corps

Balk events starts here:
######################### 1.d4 (Queen's Pawn Game)(+0.37) #########################

In the middle of an inspection of the Queen's Tower, alarming news reached Queen Chrysalis

"What do you mean you killed Agrynnis's favorite aide", she is surrounded by idiots, the Queen thought.

"Well it seemed obvious that she was a Thora-" Vaspier meekly argued.

"And the people found out because?" the Queen cuts him off.

"Forgive me, My-"

"GET OUT!" The queen turned to his Queen's Guard Captain

"Lacin, interference"

"Yes, my queen!" Said the captain as he round up a few of his unit to intercept the incoming trouble.

"Gather the army... and the air force... get me everything" The Hive Queen turns to her trusted Marshall.

"Everything? My Que-" Trimmel was in the middle of realizing the severity of the situation.

"EVERYTHING!"

The white pieces have the advantage. As they are the first to move.

>>> And that is me

#Dev Note: Moves all army and planes to vesalia

######################### 1...d5 (Closed Game)(+0.38) #########################

A river of black chitin can be seen with a view high enough, and the highest place in Vesalipolis is the mid-construction Queen's Tower.

It is on the boulevard directly leading to the tower.

It is flowing, like all rivers should.

From the tower's view, It is getting closer.

The black queen's pawn moved two squares foward.

But you already moved yours thusly.

A pawn moving two ranks is the norm in openings

The two pawns now block eachother.

>>> Book move, not the best one.

######################### 2.c4 (Queen's Gambit)(+0.33) #########################

The Door to Chrysalis's room is wide open, she was merely inspecting the construction, but it suffices as the chessboard for now.

The four queens marched in, allowed by the queen's guard to pass, and stood still opposite Chrysalis, who was seated and confident.

"I see my loyal subjects have came to me for a petition, and as your benevolent ruler, I would do whatever it is to solve, whatever issues you may be experiencing"

The four Major queens, each ruling over their major hive, are each now uncertain as to what to do. Why is she not panicking? This is essentially a coup!

"I understand that my... forgetful subordinate, Vaspier, has failed to educate his underlings about the concept of... boundaries."

The Great Queen continued: "Rest assured all responsible will be punished. VASPIER!"

Vaspier, the Great Imperial Nobody, troted in with a pistol obviously strapped, and a prisoner in hoof, bound in chains, gagged and blindfolded.

"As your Great Queen, I have a suggestion about how to solve this current, unpleasantness..."

A gunshot rang; the prisoner is now dead, right infront all of the major queens.

"Of course justice is paramount, but we need to fix the root problem..." Three more gunshots rang.

"So i suggest I devolve power and sovereignty, unto you all, my subjects." Four more shots, as Vasiper reloads

"No, in fact, I can do better: Complete, independance! We will go back to the old borders! And you will no longer need to answer to me!" 

Eight more shots, followed the sound of reloading. And then...

Silence.

"What do you say?"

>>> Take the bait you imbeciles

######################### 2...dxc4 (Queen's Gambit Accepted)(+0.67) #########################

The four queens each are there on their own volition; but it is Major Queen Argynnis of Vraks, that has the strongest reason to show. 

It is in fact her influence that swayed everyone to join. Her favorite aide, and a relatively close family member, died at the hooves of... this corpse.

It is harder to argue her position now. Chrysalis's retirement is now completely out of the picture.

The other three queens has lost all confidence. Most of them really weren't completely convinced about the plan to begin with.

"Very well, I think this is exceedingly graceful of you" Said Argynnis.

A total misplay.

>>> Should have moved your knight
