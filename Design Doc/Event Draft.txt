Thoraxian Events


Countrywide Raids Fail

    The raids against the Thoraxians have been an utter failure! It seems the harmonists have infiltrated our government and managed to get forewarning. Every place we raided was either empty or we faced strong resistance. Queen Chrysalis is already demanding someone’s head. 
    The even more unfortunate part is that it appears our raids have only galvanized local populations against us. We are receiving reports of increased hostility in our vassal states and Thoraxian propaganda has been rising.

“Damn those Thoraxians”

Friends from high and far.
Thorax was looking at the map of Changeling lands planning his next attack when he was interrupted by a Changeling in a green beret saluting him. "Commander!" said the soldier in the Changeling tongue. Thorax nodded and the soldier continued speaking.
“What is it?” 
Soldier catches his breath. "There are Equestrians and Crystalians behind the tent and their leaders have requested your audience immediately!" He saluted before walking out of the tent. Thorax frowned lightly as he adjusted his beret and walked out. What reason did ponies have to come here?
The force was led by two familiar ponies and a dragon, each wearing uniforms similar to those he had seen in Stalliongrad alongside Crystal Pony engineers and volunteers. As soon as the ponies saw the changelings, they reached out to greet them. Those who led these expeditionary forces were the most surprising among all. From behind two unicorns, one light purple talking to the dragon and the other blue, wearing a stereotypical mage’s hat with a uniform that more resembles a suit rather than a khaki jacket. And in the middle is a small purple dragon wearing a cape with a snowflake emblem. As they recognize these ponies, Starlight and Trixie, Thorax smiles at them. When he was saved by them.
“Starlight! Trixie and Spike!” he called, hugging them three, which they caught by surprise but a pleasant surprise nonetheless.
“Hehehe well hello there! Commander Thorax” starlight grins and hugs back. “How's your battle between good and evil?” she asked. “Meh… We're kinda hanging there..” Thorax answers though he frowns at Starlight calling his enemies evil.
“Well don't worry bud! We're here to help!” Spike exclaimed as Thorax stopped hugging them. “These Crystal ponies here are the Royal Frozen Butterfly Engineering Corp, these guys are expert Engineers! Right boys?!” Spike explained and called to the crystal ponies, who responded with mixtures of cheers and shouts of confirmation. 
Thorax grinned “We can always use Engineers.” The Engineers cheered again. Thorax turned to Spike, “How did you get these guys, I got a response from Cadence stating that she can’t spare any resources?” 
Spike nodded “Being the Hero of the Crystal Empire comes with some perks. These guys are all reserve engineers we figured they can help your rebellion.” Thorax was about to enquire on the Stalliongradians when Trixie stepped in between him and Spike. 
“And I Great and Powerful Trixie shall use my knowledge and magic that is unparalleled on the continent, nay the world, with my wonderful assistant Starlight Glimmer!” Trixie boasts, which starlight just rolled her eyes. “We are here to assist you in the battle against big bad evil changelings!”
Thorax grinned at her boasting but then frowned at her last words. He gestured to the group to follow him into his tent, once inside he spoke to them, “Please stop calling the Chrysalians all evil… Chrysalis may be an arrogant tyrant but most changelings are not evil.” Starlight and her group all nodded at his words.
“Regardless it is wonderful to have you three here, it is nice to see Celestia still can send help!” 
“Well technically weren't allowed to come here to help you” , Starlight stated.
Thorax tilts his head. “Wha-why??” he asked.
Starlight Sighs, “ is something about not being allowed to volunteer or something because of something about someone’s problems.”
Thorax looks confused “What does that mean?”
Spike replied. “Celestia senses that the politics of Equestria is in a difficult place right now, and sending ponies and money to a race that recently attacked Equestria does not look good for her.” Thorax nodded.
“Alright well, I am glad you guys came… So you got help from Stalliongrad?” Starlight chuckled as both Spike and Trixie looked amused. 
“Those ponies are former members of the Severyanan White Army, most of the white army left for Zebrica but some, many of whom joined our volunteer legion, stayed in Equestria.” Spike explained. A Severyanan came into the tent and nodded to the group.
“I apologize for overhearing… We are here to help you to save you from the tyranny of the Chrysalis hooves! We may have not saved our beloved motherland from the vile reds but we would not let other brave creatures be crushed by tyranny!” he said. Starlight nodded before asking him something in a foreign language. The Severyanan replied before going out of the tent. The rest of the group looked at her curiously.
“What? Oh yeah. I know Severyanan because most of that cult I formed originally spoke the language.” The others nodded. 
“Well Anyways. Thank you for joining me in this struggle… I appreciate it!” Thorax smiled.
“No problem!” Spike said, swishing his envoy’s cape. “ Now let's see our situation, Commander Thorax,” Starlight grinned confidently. 
Thorax nodded and gestured towards the map upon the table.
